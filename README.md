# PathCAM2
PathCAM2 - a 3d CAM gcode toolpath generator

This is an clone of the project https://github.com/xenovacivus/PathCAM .
The origial is imperial. This clone will be metric.

The plan is to add/change the following:
- Convert to metric -> done
- Add fixed rotation buttons -> done
- Swap left and right buttons -> in progress
- Add material size and thickness
- Add origin
- Add offset object to material top
- Add routing to remove all material above object
- Option to do only rough cutting
- Option to set mill type: round or square
-

I will regulary create a msi installer. Later on will find out how to do 
a svn to git commit of the source codes.

Cheers

Arnoud
